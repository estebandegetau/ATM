# Introduction

## Motivation

-   A key objective of the *Banco del Bienestar* is to provide financial services to previously unattended areas.

-   Financial inclusion in Mexico is low relative to other latin american countries [@navis2020].

-   The program rests on the theory that demand for financial services has gone unmet by private supply because of missing financial infraestructure, i.e. brick and mortar banks in rural areas.

## Research question

On the other hand, the program may be crowding out private banks and increasing competition in areas where they already operate.

> What is the net effect of *Banco del Bienestar* on private banks' geographical access to clients?

# Data

## Data sources

National Directory of Economic Units (DENUE) from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI).

-  The DENUE is a directory of all economic units in Mexico, including their location, economic activity, and size.
- Yearly updates for big businesses and/or key economic sectors.
- Complete updates every 5 years through the Economic Census.


## Cleaning

- We filtered the data to include only banks.
- *Banco del Bienestar* branches were easily identified by their name.
- We use DENUE data from 2021 to 2023 to see changes in branches' locations over time, and see whether private banks are opening new branches in areas where *Banco del Bienestar* has invested.

## Next steps

Take the distance between *Banco del Bienestar* and private banks:

$$
D_{ji}^1 = \text{Dist}(BdB_j^{2023}, PB_i^{2023})
$$

Then, take the distance between *Banco del Bienestar* 2023 locations and private banks in 2021:
$$
D_{ji}^0 = \text{Dist}(BdB_j^{2023}, PB_i^{2021})
$$

## Change in distance

We can calculate the change in distance between *Banco del Bienestar* and private banks:
$$
\delta_{ij} = D_{ij}^1 - D_{ij}^0
$$

## $K$ nearest private banks

However, private branches may be nearing remote regions regardless of the program. 

A way to control for this is to compare changes in distance for only the $K$ nearest private banks to each program branch location $j$:

$$
\hat \delta_j(K) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^K \delta_{ij}
$$

## Hypothesis test

Finally, we can test whether the average change in distance is different from zero:

$$
H_0: \mathbb E(\hat \delta_i)  = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \mathbb E(\hat \delta_{i}) \neq 0
$$

To show whether private banks are moving *on average* towards or away from *Banco del Bienestar* branches:
