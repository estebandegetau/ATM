# Introduction

## Motivation

-   A key objective of the *Banco del Bienestar* is to provide financial services to previously unattended areas.

-   The program rests on the theory that demand for financial services has gone unmet by private supply because of missing financial infraestructure, i.e. brick and mortar banks in rural areas.
